Central Registrar for Cooperative Societies (CRCS)
The Central Registrar for Cooperative Societies (CRCS) is responsible for registering and 
regulating multistate cooperative societies in India, in accordance with the MSCS Act of 2002. 
As part of this hackathon, the task is to design and develop a comprehensive dashboard for the 
upcoming new CRCS portal that will streamline the registration process, handle amendments 
and appeals, and manage annual returns for the registered societies.

This dash board is created by me for Govt of India.
